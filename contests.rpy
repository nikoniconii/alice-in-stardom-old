    a "{i}The others are taking this rather calmly though. Lis and Cherry are fooling around in a corner, giggling. Grant looks stoic even in that colourful Hawaiian shirt, back straight against his chair while the stylist does his hair.{/i}"

    m "Persian horse riders from the 9th century also wore heels to help hold their feet in stirrups. If anything, it is your view that you are obliged to wear heels for the viewing pleasure of men that is oppressive."
    m "You should embrace heels as a possible fashion choice to make yourself look good, for your own confidence and joy."
    
    a "{i}Rich, pretty, perfect, and smart too? Maybe Mary should change her last name to Sue.{/i}"

    m "Who cares what he thinks? You are sexy and you know it. Now lift your chin up, arch your back, show your curves, swing that pretty bottom of yours. Move like you own the floor, and I assure you that you won’t fall."
    
    a "You're asking the impossible. I'm not a model."
    
    m "Well, I have worked as a model, so I know it isn’t impossible."
    
    a "{i}Right. It makes total sense for Mary Sue to be a supermodel. She’s probably also the daughter of a billionaire and can communicate with eight animal species through telepathy.{/i}"

    j "Welcome again to your most spectacular idol show of the year, Supernova! I am your host, Jacque Bellavance!"
    j "Last time, we’ve introduced our six contestants. You’ve had the chance to see their unique glory, taken your pick about who will make it to the throne of stardom’s next idol. Now, our contestants will be pitted against each other."
    j "Only the best will remain. One will be eliminated tonight!"
    j "Without further ado, lend your applause to our first contestant, Mary Viswanathan!"
    
    a "{i}The bright lights shine down on Mary’s shining black hair. Her dark skin gleams while she waves at the audience, drawing roaring applause.{/i}"
    a "{i}Charming, cheerful music blares out the speakers and Mary starts dancing along with it, her peach-colored dress whirling with the rhythm.{/i}"
    a "{i}Though her performance last week was elegant and formal, she completely changed her style today. Her voice is one of joy and life, skipping easily with the beat of drums and cymbals.{/i}"
    a "{i}She’s smiling wide like the summer sun, absolutely stunning in her radiance. The crowd becomes more excited as the chorus takes her notes higher, their glow sticks pounding the air. I stare at the scene, only realizing then that I’ve been mouthing the words of her lyrics.{/i}"
    
    t "Captivating."
    
    j "Thank you very much for that wonderful performance, Mary. Our next contestant will be Grant Jordan. Let’s see how he will fare!"
    
    a "{i}If Mary is the sun, then Grant is the breeze. The way he carries himself onto the stage is just like that - easy, relaxed. I can almost feel the moisture and saltiness in my breath as though I’m lying there by the seaside.{/i}"
    a "{i}Unlike Mary, who relied on the stage band and their lively accompaniment, Grant is singing along with his own guitar strums, his deep voice weaving in and out seamlessly. I nod along, impressed.{/i}"
    
    j "Thank you, Grant. That was an interesting contrast in style, but equally fitting of the summer theme. Will our next contestant, Lisa Hashimori, bring something new to the table too? All yours, Lis."
    
    a "{i}Lis comes on stage with a sleeveless dress shirt, purple tie, and matching checker-patterned pleated skirt. Just the attire screams of youthful vigour.{/i}"
    a "{i}When the drums start beating a lively beat in the background and Lis leaps up to embrace their sounds, I know this is going to be good.{/i}"
    a "{i}Her high soprano is usually poorly-suited for rock, but this warm, lovely pop rock is just perfect for her. It sounds like something right out of an anime!{/i}"
    
    j "I think I’ve nodded a little too hard along with that song. My neck hurts a little!"
    j "Let’s see if our next contestant would be a little more calming. Raisa Cherenkov, you’re up next!"
    
    a "{i}The simple piano accompaniment rolls through the air with Cherry’s soothing voice. There is also something youthful about her singing, but unlike Lis, it doesn’t have the excess energy.{/i}"
    a "{i}The song itself is of mid-tempo, soft and delicate, like the raindrops the lyrics describe. Cherry takes these raindrops from the skies, letting them drip onto shallow puddles, rippling lakes, great oceans.{/i}"
    a "{i}There is both something small and relatable, and something larger and more meaningful in what she expresses.{/i}"
    
    k "This girl is really someone special."
    
    t "Her technique can use further polishing, but her talent is undeniable. She can be missing half the notes and most people won’t even notice."
    
    a "She missed some notes?"
    
    t "She sang one of the lines almost completely different from the original."
    
    k "But if she sounds better, I doubt anybody would care about the original."
    
    a "{i}I have never heard this song, so I can’t really comment on it. But seriously? Sounding better than the original?{/i}"
    a "{i}Is that even possible?{/i}"
    
    k "A friend of mine wants to sign the girl into his record company after hearing her Mary had a Little Lamb last week, can you believe it?{/i}"
    
    t "If I had the money, I would."
    
    a "{i}To be so good that even Taylor would willingly admit her talents...that’s amazing!{/i}"
    
    k "I take it that you aren’t gonna go down without a fight though, Taylor."
    
    t "I am not fighting. I just think I’m not necessarily less skilled than her."
    
    k "Oh?"
    
    t "She beats me in potential. I will admit that much. But I am far more experienced."
    
    j "Thank you, Raisa. That was beautiful. Next up, we have Taylor Warren."
    
    k "Show us what your experience will do for you then."
    
    a "{i}Taylor sure is no match for Cherry appearance-wise. While both of them went for the floral theme, Cherry matched her rosy wreath with a delicate pink dress, while Taylor just put on the same faded blue t-shirt as last week.{/i}"
    a "{i}Which one of the stylists let him walk out on stage with a shirt that clashes that horribly with the mult-colored flower ring around his neck?{/i}"
    a "{i}I suppose his stubborn attitude does give him a unique kind of charisma, though. Once again, he opts for minimal background music while he sings, opening the song with smooth falsetto.{/i}"
    a "{i}Would it be accurate to call his singing wailing? That would give it a negative connotation, would it? But I mean it in a good way, actually. There is just so much emotion in the way he sings.{/i}"
    a "{i}But if I were to try to convey such sadness and regret, I would’ve tried for a stronger sound. I would’ve tried to sing my lungs out. Taylor does no such thing.{/i}"
    a "{i}He has so much control at even pitches difficult for me to reach, switching easily to lower tones for drastic, powerful effects.{/i}"
    a "{i}The song, originally a summer tune about some generic campus, transforms to a bittersweet, nostalgic kind of sound. The simple, metallic notes are underlain by hints of darkness and remorse.{/i}"
    a "{i}Why is it that Taylor is always depressed? Why does he want to express this on-stage?{/i}"
    a "{i}So much I don’t understand, but his voice propels me to try. The more I listen, the more I want to know...I’m being carried away by his message.{/i}"
    a "{i}The crowd is silent after his performance. He bows and leaves us stunned to our spots.{/i}"
    
    k "Kitty, you better snap out of it before you get up there."
    
    a "Wh... what!?"
    
    k "You haven't forgotten that you're up next, right?"
    
    a "..."
    a "{i}Shit!{/i}"
    a "{i}That’s right. This is a contest. I’m not part of the audience. I’m supposed to be a participant!{/i}"
    
    k "Don’t look so shocked. Like I said, if you can’t outshine the others, then make the biggest fool out of yourself. A catastrophic failure would have entertainment value too."
    
    a "{i}Like I want to be a failure on that level!{/i}"
    
    j "That was certainly a memorable performance, Taylor. Next, we have our last contestant, Alice Carroll."
    
    a "{i}I don’t even get the chance to practice the first line of my song in my head before I get unceremoniously shoved onto the stage by my smirking boss.{/i}"
    a "{i}Shit, shit, shit, shit...I’m so not prepared for this!{/i}"
    a "{i}Oh God, please, somebody, save me!{/i}"

    a "{i}The musical accompaniment is so plain.{/i}"
    a "{i}It’s not plain in an absolute sense, but compared to the uniqueness of Cherry and Taylor’s performances, it’s just so common. It’s totally something a regular schoolgirl would sing at a karaoke place with her friends.{/i}"
    a "{i}But is that necessarily a bad thing?{/i}"
    a "{i}I have been a regular schoolgirl till just a few months ago. After graduation, I became a regular working-class young adult. I’m just a plain and ordinary girl. Nothing special.{/i}"
    a "{i}But that’s not something to be ashamed of, right?{/i}"
    a "{i}I remember watching a show like this on TV. Of course, you’d want to see the superstar in all his glory, singing so brilliantly that it nearly stops your heart. But what you feel is that you must worship him.{/i}"
    a "{i}He is so far away from you, so difficult to reach. His song is beautiful, yes, but it shames you to sing along.{/i}"
    a "{i}I’m not a superstar, but that doesn’t mean I can’t sing for them, the audience, the people just like me.{/i}"
    a "{i}What did Mary say? Chin up, back straight, show ’em those hips. 1, 2, 3, 4, click those heels forward!{/i}"
    
    a "Sing with me!"
    
    a "{i}The colorful lights play on my face. They are dazzling. They are pretty. I pour everything I have into my voice, amplifying it above the crowd’s cheers.{/i}"
    a "{i}I can see them wave along with me. I walk towards them, waving back, pumping my free hand high into the air with the beat.{/i}"
    a "{i}I’m no longer on the stage. I’m in a karaoke room. The music video is playing on the screen behind me, and I’m going along with it, imitating the pop idol group dancing with the tune.{/i}"
    a "{i}I’m gonna outdo Katie’s score on the karaoke machine. Nothing is going to stop me. What is there to stop me?{/i}"
    a "{i}I don’t care that this is a generic sound. This is my sound. If what Cherry and Taylor sang were considered unique, then so is this. This is me. I should be proud of my identity, no matter what it is.{/i}"
    a "{i}This summer, I’m gonna be an idol.{/i}"

    di "Ready to pack your bags, Intie?"
    
    a "Am I not supposed to stay even if I were to be eliminated?"

    a "That’s...a little...optimistic, don’t you think?"
    
    m "Well, do you really think you did worse than the rest of us?"
    
    a "I didn’t really say that, did I? But because I’m not crazy good and much, much better than everybody else, I can’t help but at least consider the possibility of elimination, right?"
    
    m "It’s not about whether that possibility is there. It’s about whether to consider it."

    t "If you think you did well, just admit it. You have every right."
    
    a "Taylor..."

    a "{i}Damn you, Jacque! Can’t you just skip this part and only make me say something after I get eliminated? You’re making me so depressed right now!{/i}"

    a "{i}Gosh, that was the lamest elimination speech in history!{/i}"

    g "We all have our reasons to join this contest. I would very much like to win, but even if I were to be eliminated today, I would have no regrets."
    g "I met some great people here. I learned a lot. It was a wonderful time, and I am happy that I’ll still get to spend time around these wonderful peers of mine regardless of the results today."
    g "I will learn more from them, and teach them more of what I’ve got. I’ll get better and come back onto this stage in the next season. I will win."

    a "{i}She comes to a stop at the very center to strike a confident pose, drawing the mic slowly to her lips. There is a dramatic pause before she parts them and lets her voice flow through, but when it does, it’s wild and commanding.{/i}"
    a "{i}She starts in a low, growling tone, working her way to a shouting chorus. Her voice is thick and powerful, riding above the driving beat. The lights paint her white top many bright hues.{/i}"
    a "{i}She submerges herself in them, bending low, her free arm reaches out to the sides as though trying to embrace an invisible energy. The next repetition of the chorus sees her swinging her head with the rhythm.{/i}"
    a "{i}She’s so into it that it’s almost infectious. Some of the crowd has stood, following her movements. Like Taylor said last week, she’s captivating.{/i}"
    a "{i}Mary is the very definition of a superstar.{/i}"
    
    j "That was a fireball of energy from Mary Viswanathan, don’t you agree? Can our next contestant match this fervor? Go for it, Lisa Hashimori!"
    
    a "{i}Lis’ selection has a similar style to Mary’s. It’s bright, it’s modern, like the neon signs flashing outside the clubs downtown. Likewise, Lis is as dominant a personality as Mary.{/i}"
    a "{i}While Mary has a distinctly feminine appeal, Lis is more androgynous, her outfit wasting no opportunity to show off those muscles in her powerful frame.{/i}"
    a "{i}Lis also has that towering height to her advantage. She’s demanding attention just by standing there. The stage, no matter how brightly lit, is nothing compared to her presence.{/i}"
    a "{i}She takes it easily, her strides along the metallic floors like that of a king walking up to his throne.{/i}"
    a "{i}Lis’ voice is higher, shriller than Mary’s. But what she lacks in richness of tone, she makes up for with sheer enthusiasm. She knows the song like the back of her hand, singing it just as she likes it.{/i}"
    a "{i}She isn’t afraid of deviating from the original, imparting her own spin to the tune to make it even more splendid. She pounds the beat with well-timed yells, bringing the heat up a couple degrees in the process. It’s literally burning in here!{/i}"

    a "{i}Compared to Mary and Lis, Cherry certainly doesn’t have the same commanding presence on-stage, but her timid demeanor does suit the song well. While the music is still upbeat, it isn’t as powerful and bright as Mary and Lis’ selections.{/i}"
    a "{i}Cherry’s voice, with its metallic, raspy timbre, brings out the softer notes, giving them a nice ring. It evokes the image of the moon, radiant, but more subdued than the rays of the sun.{/i}"

    t "Guess it's my turn..."
    
    a "{i}Taylor may be wearing a brighter shirt today, but certainly his singing is still dark as ever. His song selection is futuristic and carries a decent beat throughout.{/i}"
    a "{i}However, the melody isn’t all sunshine. While not completely despairing, the music nonetheless moves at a slow pace, meandering through obstacle after obstacle, not quite resolving the tension that has built up.{/i}"
    a "{i}Taylor adds additional emotional strain to the sound with the echoing voice he uses. He vibrates the notes in such way that gives it a hollowness. Despite the pitch moving higher with progression of the song, something keeps pulling it back.{/i}"
    a "{i}He gives the feeling of a strenuous climb up an alien planet’s barren landscape, slipping on glowing blue ice with each pull upwards, and with it, reminiscence of a better time somewhere warmer and more familiar.{/i}"
    
    m "Taylor is quite something too. He is very skilled, but just why does he always have to make everything sound so melancholic?"
    
    l "Style perhaps?"
    
    m "That’s an awfully shallow guess, Lisa. Only someone with a depth of emotions can sing out such depth of emotions."
    
    l "Too difficult. I don't get it."
    
    a "Rather than style, I think Taylor is trying to express his current feelings. He’s singing from the bottom of his soul."
    
    a "{i}It’s a little disturbing, but that’s just proof of how good he is.{/i}"
    
    j "Wow, now that sounded like a bittersweet love story from 2116. Another amazing experience you’ve given us, Taylor. Thank you!"
    j "Now for our last remaining contestant, Alice Carroll, what kind of experience will she endow us with? Will it be a futuristic tragedy?"
    
    a "{i}Oh God. Tragedy? You mean my personal tragedy of being the crowd’s target of ridicule?{/i}"

    a "{i}When I’m watching her on the stage, it’s as though I’ve stepped into her shoes, walking the paths she has taken, experiencing the emotions filling her heart. They are simple emotions, but they are clear and true.{/i}"

    a "{i}Harps sound in the background, strings plucked one by one. They form a beautiful melody, but it’s thin and sparse, like something is lacking. Mary’s voice fills the gaps, humming, crying.{/i}"
    a "{i}Her voice, deep, colorful, paints the night sky with the moon and stars. The calm light unveils snowflakes that have been dancing in the frigid air all along, falling upon our shoulders to dust a soft layer of white.{/i}"

    a "{i}But that is just a pointless musing. Perhaps this is the real Mary. Of course she’s not truly perfect. But she’s a person who tries very hard to be so. She may be nervous this moment. She may be lost. But she doesn’t let it show.{/i}"

    a "{i}Taylor doesn’t force too much air into his singing, but somehow, he manages to project the clear sounds into the audience. It’s like it doesn’t take any effort. But at the same time, I know that’s just a show of his skills.{/i}"
    a "{i}I know Taylor is very skilful from day one. However, that skill never actually translates to enhancing the mood of songs that he sings. Instead, he warps every song into something of his own, feeding it with hopeless melancholy.{/i}"
    a "{i}He does the same with this wintery music. What originally sounds like an innocent walk down a snow-lined sidewalk becomes a walk down memory lane.{/i}"

    a "{i}A lonely, depressing melody sounds as Cherry takes to the stage, her dark, layered dress dragging behind her. She sings as her heels click down the stage, her voice thin, airy, like an eerie fog drawn across a rural night.{/i}"
    a "{i}Her skin, so white it’s as though blood doesn’t run beneath it, and eyes a blue that reminds me of the planet Uranus, Cherry gives off the impression of an ice witch from folklore, immortalized as a marble figurine twirling on an old music box.{/i}"
    a "{i}With each repetition of the main theme, this illusion becomes more like reality. This is the power of Cherry’s singing. She possesses a unique timbre and wide vocal range, giving her much needed flexibility for expressing whatever emotions she desires.{/i}"

    a "{i}Is this the inspiration Taylor was talking about? I don’t know. Maybe I have been so dissatisfied with my life up to this point that I’ve gotten used to filling the hollows with my imagination?{/i}"
    a "{i}That's a morbid thought.{/i}"
    a "{i}But even if that were the case, I’m starting to figure out a solution to my dissatisfaction.{/i}"
    a "{i}When I think I can’t do something, tell myself I can.{/i}"
    a "{i}When I can’t see an opportunity, go find it.{/i}"
    a "{i}Standing here on this stage makes me remember all the dreams I’ve tossed out because of my old cowardice. I thought I was just being realistic when I gave up on pursuing them. In the end, I was just hiding from the possibility of failure.{/i}"
    a "{i}Who cares if I fail, really? Myself?{/i}"
    a "{i}So if I can forgive myself in the case I fail, nobody else would have a problem with it, right?{/i}"
    a "{i}What is there to fear, then?{/i}"
    a "{i}If we really think about it, fear is often a constructed quality. A figment of our own thoughts and illusions.{/i}"
    a "{i}That’s why even darkness, no matter how seemingly fearsome at first glance, can be turned on its head to something interesting, amazing, flavorful.{/i}"

    a "{i}Taylor still hasn’t changed much. While Cherry and I both went with the clothes chosen by our production staff, he just put on a simple black shirt to match his pants. I wasn’t under the impression that he would be taking this seriously.{/i}"
    a "{i}But the breath he takes to compose himself in front of his audience makes me aware of how wrong I was.{/i}"
    a "{i}Just the way he’s carrying himself is telling me that he’s going to offer a real, amazing performance this time.{/i}"
    a "{i}The clicking beats sound. He lifts his head, eyes snapping open while he starts singing.{/i}"
    a "{i}In all the previous weeks, he has just been venting his sadness with his voice. Tonight, he is different.{/i}"
    a "{i}There is no hidden grief in the wispy tone he uses. I don’t know how he does it, but he gives a mysterious vibe to the way it rings - I hear it echoing across the room.{/i}"
    a "{i}I get the sense that something is watching me, in front of me, behind me, to my sides. It’s certainly creepy and fits right into the dark theme.{/i}"
    a "{i}That’s not all. Taylor layers his voice with vibrato. The first hearing tells a mystery, yes, but that’s only the beginning. The pulses afterwards give some sort of answer, but no resolution.{/i}"
    a "{i}I feel like I’m tossed into some kind of futuristic conspiracy, a confusing new world order, beautiful on the outside, dystopian within.{/i}"
    a "{i}The song descends into a rap verse. His pitch dips down with it, low, whispering.{/i} They’re watching you. They’re all-seeing. They’re listening to your words of despair. There is no praying."
    a "{i}The melody returns with a fire of change. Taylor cracks a glow stick in his hand to draw an arc of blue-green above him. There is defiance in his voice. There is strength and determination. I sense the hope within him, like a light in the dark.{/i}"
    a "{i}He whips the light down like a sword, or maybe it’s more like a gun, ready to shoot laser through an enemy of evil. I’ve been reduced to a little fangirl. I just want to tell him how “cool” he looks and sounds!{/i}"
    a "{i}But beneath the story he’s telling through the melody and lyrics, I sense something more personal. Is this Taylor’s own growth?{/i}"
    a "{i}Is this...what I’ve inspired him to become?{/i}"
    a "{i}The darkness he had previously drowned himself in is actually more like a cocoon. Tonight, he has broken free. It’s like the dystopian society of his song, so established that you cannot take it down in one go else humanity itself would crumble.{/i}"
    a "{i}But awareness will allow mankind to rationalize right and wrong, bring perception to society’s suffering, thus evolving the world into a better place.{/i}"
    a "{i}In Taylor’s case, he has begun to evolve towards a more meaningful way of expressing himself.{/i}"
    a "{i}Whatever his pain is, the way he was venting it wouldn’t go anywhere. We felt what he was trying to portray, but we couldn’t connect with it. Singing is an art, and art is not only a mode of expression, but also a way to communicate.{/i}"
    a "{i}It seems that Taylor has finally figured it out. He’s still himself, but he’s also using his inner feelings as motivation towards expressing other ideas, to tell stories that may not be his own.{/i}"
    a "{i}He’s aware of what’s troubling him, and in singing about them, he comes to confront them on his own will. He ends up defeating them with his song, changing the mindset he originally had.{/i}"
    
    t "In order for the light to shine so brightly, the darkness must be present."
    
    a "{i}Is this what he’s trying to say about this week’s theme? Is this also his personal discovery?{/i}"
    
    j "An intriguing performance by Taylor Warren. There’s an elegance to the simplicity of his voice, and yet he manages to convey ideas far deeper and profound. It certainly leaves me with many thoughts."
    j "It looks to be another tough decision this week, my audience. Let us cast our votes during the commercial break, and we’ll be back with the results. Who will make it to the final showdown? We shall see in a moment!"

    a "{i}The three of us wait anxiously at the prep room for the results. One of us will have to go while the other two make it to the finals. Would I be the one eliminated?{/i}"
    a "{i}I don’t want to be the one. I want to stay.{/i}"
    a "{i}But even if I lose here, I don’t think I’d have any regrets. If not for this show, I wouldn’t have met all these great people. I wouldn’t have met the real me. How else would I be able to face my dreams head-on?{/i}"
    a "{i}I didn’t think I had the talent to pursue this road, but now, I know talent is something shaped by hard work and circumstances.{/i}"
    a "{i}To hone a talent, you must seek out a platform for training it, then study and practice till it’s sharp as a sword, shine like a diamond. I know I’ve done it this time, all thanks to the unforeseen opportunity and my own resilience from backing down.{/i}"
    a "{i}I’m not afraid of failing, because that doesn’t make me a failure. I still succeeded in many things, for which I should be proud.{/i}"

    a "{i}The end of the road, the last showdown of this contest.{/i}"
    
    j "Welcome to week 5 of the Supernova idol contest, the final stage of the competition for the coveted throne of your next superstar!"
    j "Taylor Warren, a veteran in the music industry. While he has stayed behind the scenes till now, he is a well-known composer of many songs."
    j " His audience is spread across the globe, many praising the strong emotions he manages to evoke in his colorful melodies and driving rhythms."
    j "By entering this contest, he has taken off on what he describes as a path of self-discovery. Now, he is not only writing music for us, but also performing it live, showing us exactly the messages he wishes to convey."
    j "What are his inspirations? What are his motivations? Now, he will lay his soul before us. Taylor, the stage is yours!"
    
    a "{i}We have walked a long way.{/i}"
    a "{i}Jacque is right. It really has been a month of sweat and tears. We have met many people along the way, but now, this is a path that we must take alone.{/i}"
    a "{i}The audience is watching us. Our friends and family are watching us. We are surrounded, but the moment you set foot on the stage, you are by yourself. You are in a place where they can’t reach you.{/i}"
    a "{i}Still, you must shine for them, like the sun and moon, stars and meteors. You are high above the people, but you must make them gravitate towards you, show them the flame that burns in your heart, and use it to warm their hearts too.{/i}"
    a "{i}That's what Taylor is doing now.{/i}"
    a "{i}This is the first time I’ve seen him like this. He is no longer the quiet, sarcastic personality he once was, hiding behind a mop of dirty blond and thick glasses.{/i}"
    a "{i}The creased shirt, pressed collar, crisp, clean lines of his suit - he is positively radiant today. And that’s just his appearance. His demeanor, his voice, they are all bright and powerful.{/i}"
    a "{i}He has left his shell far behind him. This is the new Taylor. The real Taylor. And the talent he is showcasing is absolutely amazing!{/i}"
    a "{i}The guitar riffs are sick. The drums are pounding with my heartbeat. His voice starts deep and rises like a bird taking flight. Not just any bird. He’s an eagle, soaring high, spreading its wings to glide the azure skies.{/i}"
    a "{i}The floodlights, reflecting golden off his hair, are like sunshine crowning eagle feathers. It’s so bright that I must squint against his light. This surely is proof of his kingship over the heavens.{/i}"
    a "{i}Even though Taylor has always been so talented, I think he couldn’t have performed like this without the struggles he has been through over the past weeks.{/i}"
    a "{i}Only after a long night does the light of dawn appear beautiful. Only after a cold winter does spring feel warm. Without loss, there is no gain. Without falling down, you never learn how to stand back up.{/i}"
    a "{i}Taylor has regretted. Taylor has second-guessed his own decisions. He wondered whether he should really have been here.{/i}"
    a "{i}He asked if he were not the one standing on the stage, if someone else took his place instead, would the contest nights be more interesting, more entertaining to watch.{/i}"
    a "{i}Was he more suitable for standing backstage, watching others sing for him, or should he be the one out there, singing for us?{/i}"
    a "{i}I’m sure those were tough questions. I think he thought long and hard about them. There were times when his answers took him wandering backwards, regressing to depression and self-pity.{/i}"
    a "{i}But I’m proud to say that I, along with the others, have helped show him the way.{/i}"
    a "{i}There is nobody who knows you better than yourself. If you were too afraid to sing your own songs, nobody would be able to do it for you.{/i}"
    a "{i}Life is full of hardships. We will face pain, we will face loss. But if we back down, we would just be standing in place, trapped where these dark feelings will continue to consume us.{/i}"
    a "{i}Though moving forward may sometimes feel like clawing through tangles of barbed vines, our bodies may feel like they’re being torn from outside in and inside out, we must continue through these obstacles.{/i}"
    a "{i}Searing heat, freezing cold, dark nights, uncertain futures - these are all scary images that may flash through our minds, but in overcoming them, we become stronger.{/i}"
    a "{i}We are swords. We need to be abraded again and again to be polished into sharp blades.{/i}"
    a "{i}Taylor screams his hopes into the audience. They roar with him, captured by his brilliance. We all want a better world. It is what we as humans are wired to wish for.{/i}"
    a "{i}Taylor connects these dreams together and gives sound to it, amplifies it for more and more people to hear. It is no longer his personal strength that is sustaining him, but the strength of many, many more of his supporters.{/i}"
    a "{i}That is what an idol should be. He is not afraid of his own dreams. He shows them to us. He shoulders our dreams along with his.{/i}"
    a "{i}He makes us one. United by our common desires.{/i}"
    
    j "Thank you very much for your performance, Taylor. A most fitting climax for his month-long journey here at Supernova."
    j "Our remaining contestant is Alice Carroll. Unlike Taylor, she has little formal musical training. That is not to say she is unfamiliar with the industry. According to her, she has always been fascinated with idol groups, just like you and me."
    j "She would sing to their songs and dance to their moves, dress like them and hold her own secret concerts from the top of her bed. Her audience? No one but herself."
    j "Like any rational young person, she saw little chances of succeeding in this competitive industry. Instead of pursuing a career on the stage, she resigned herself to one behind it, interning at a television production company."
    j "Her work was hard, but very mundane and underappreciated. She carried camera cables and lifted heavy equipment, she ran whatever errands were requested of her."
    j "What could prompt her to do all this for the meagre pay she was offered, if not for the slight glimmer of hope that she would one day stand atop the stage for an audience other than herself?"
    j "Finally, she realized that she must grasp this hope else it too would eventually fade. Thus, this is why she is now here to sing for us. Alice, this is now your stage. Please make the most out of it!"
    
    a "{i}Jacque smiles at me. It’s a little hard to believe that he has made such an impressive speech from the little blurb he requested for me to submit.{/i}"
    a "{i}Of course, this is his job, but I also know that he managed to speak to my heart because that’s what I’ve shown him with my hard work, with my performances. I’ve spoken to everybody with my voice.{/i}"
    a "{i}Today, the last fireworks will be set. Regardless of outcome, this will be my last performance at Supernova, but I know it will not be my last public performance ever. I’ve already made up my mind.{/i}"
    a "{i}No matter what, I’ll not bat down my own dream again. I will pursue it. I will shine for all my fans beneath this stage!{/i}"

    a "{i}As I braid the melody into the harmony, weaving the sound waves in and out with a flawless beat, I can see my audience’s faces of awe. They are entranced by my voice, so rich and colorful, bright and warm.{/i}"
    a "{i}I don’t think I’m the same brand of idol as Taylor is. I don’t think I can stand out with the same kind of dominance. But there are some things that only I have.{/i}"
    a "{i}I can’t shoulder everybody’s dreams, but I have the capability of living my own dream, and giving others the strength to live theirs.{/i}"
    a "{i}My dancing steps take me to the very edge where I can see Lis and Cherry jumping up from the front row, trying to reach me. I can see Grant and his young sisters swaying with my beat. I can see Mary break into a wide smile, her golden eyes gleaming with delight.{/i}"
    a "{i}I know, when I’m up here, I become endowed with an energy that overflows the confines of my own self.{/i}"
    a "{i}Maybe this energy is not solely my own. Maybe it takes many people to make me who I am today. But regardless, this energy becomes something I can grasp, I can amplify and give out to those willing to receive it.{/i}"
    a "{i}Taylor calls it an inspiration. Perhaps that’s what it is.{/i}"
    a "{i}I’m not an idol who towers above all. I’m an idol who inspires!{/i}"
    
    a "You can be yourself too!"
    
    a "{i}I shout into the crowd, holding out my hand. In my mind’s eye, I see flowers blooming from my fingers, so ripe their petals catch the wind and scatter into the seats below.{/i}"
    a "{i}Pink and white, violet and orange, warm colors fill the room with feelings of spring, a season of new encounters, new beginnings.{/i}"
    a "{i}The flowers may be imaginary, but the little squares of colored tissue paper that rain down into my hands are not.{/i}"

    di "I’m just giving the audience exactly what they want to see."
    
    k "It is beautiful, seeing the final result of your own creation."
    
    di "I won’t be so arrogant to call her my creation."
    
    k "Not just my sole creation, of course. Idols are created by all their supporters."
    k "Our wishes, our aspirations, all embodied in her very being. We see a piece of ourselves in her, which is why we can’t help but fall in love with her image."
    
    di "Typical self-centered thinking from you, Katja."

    di "You know me too well."
    
    a "{i}There is no performance that belongs to a single person. To perform, there must be a recipient of what you’re trying to express. Otherwise, it is nothing but an inner musing.{/i}"
    a "{i}This performance here is not really mine. At least not mine alone. The stage crew, the audience, the makeup artist, the organizers...everybody plays a part.{/i}"
    a "{i}Then what's my role?{/i}"
    a "{i}To bring it all together, of course!{/i}"
    a "{i}Come to think of it, maybe it was wrong to compare idols to light. We aren’t the sun. We’re just objects to be shone upon.{/i}"
    a "{i}Basked in everybody’s hopes, we become an existence that inspires those watching us to pursue things that they once deemed impossible.{/i}"
    a "{i}Because they are the ones who made an impossibility like myself become reality.{/i}"
    a "{i}But these are all just philosophical blurbs that can wait for another day.{/i}"
    a "{i}At this moment, all I want to do is sing.{/i}"
    a "{i}Sing to my heart’s content. Sing with everything I have.{/i}"
    a "{i}The lights are bright. The stage beneath me so large and beautiful.{/i}"
    a "{i}My audience’s cheers warm me from within. I’m so proud. I’m so proud to be here.{/i}"
    a "{i}I wish this moment could last forever. I’ve never been so happy.{/i}"
    a "{i}Thank you, everybody. Thank you for letting me stand here before you. Thank you for giving me your attention.{/i}"
    a "{i}Thank you for letting me discover myself.{/i}"
    a "{i}Just being here, singing for you…{/i}"

############ LOSE FINALE
label finallose:    

    a "{i}The final stage.{/i}"
    a "{i}After the past few weeks, I feel confident about myself.{/i}"
    a "{i}I have worked hard. Even though it was an unexpected opportunity to participate in this contest, I think I’ve made the most out of it.{/i}"
    a "{i}I have the skill. I have the enthusiasm. I should have everything already.{/i}"
    a "{i}But Taylor's performance really shook me.{/i}"
    a "{i}How can he find the strength to not only overcome his own personal obstacles, but to also shoulder the audience’s dreams on his back?{/i}"
    a "{i}I... don't know.{/i}"
    a "{i}The music comes off easily from my tongue. I feel its melody. I feel its beat. I echo my idealized version of the song into the crowd.{/i}"
    a "{i}It should be perfect, but for some reason, I still find it lacking…{/i}"
    a "{i}Where have I gone wrong?{/i}"
    
    j "Thank you, Alice. That was another beautiful performance from you."
    j "Now, we shall hear from the audience. Who is the idol in their hearts? Voting starts now!"
    
    a "{i}My heart beats heavily. I can hardly breathe as I watch the people in the stands press on their keypads. I’m sure thousands more are currently casting their votes online.{/i}"
    a "{i}It is a strange feeling, because you know what? I actually already know the result before it is announced.{/i}"
    a "{i}I’m part of the audience too, afterall. I know what they are thinking.{/i}"
    
    j "And now, the results are in my hands. The winner of your favorite idol show, Supernova, is..."
    j "Taylor Warren!"
    
    a "{i}I hear the crowd roar in approval. I nod, clapping with them. They have made the right decision.{/i}"
    
    a "That was amazing, Taylor. What you did out here was absolutely amazing."
    
    t "I couldn’t have done it without you."
    
    a "{i}He grabs my hand and shakes it hard. His smile is a bright one, but there is something strange about his eyes...is it perhaps disappointment?{/i}"
    a "{i}At what?{/i}"
    
    a "Taylor, are you okay?"
    
    t "Ahh... I was just thinking about your... nevermind."
    t "I think it was close, the competition between you and me. One day, I’m sure you’ll become a wonderful idol."
    
    a "{i}That one day is just not today.{/i}"
    
    a "I will try harder from now on. I’m sure I’ll succeed in the future."
    
    t "Yeah. I have faith in you."
    
    a "{i}I calmly step down from the stage, its bright lights falling behind me as I move into the darkness.{/i}"
    a "{i}I would be lying if I say I have no regrets. I do, actually. I know I could’ve done better.{/i}"
    a "{i}But it’s too late. There’s nothing I can do about this now.{/i}"
    a "{i}Still, that doesn’t mean I will give up. This experience has made me realize that my dream of becoming an idol is still real as ever.{/i}"
    a "{i}I clench my fist. I will be back.{/i}"
    a "{i}I will make my dream come true someday!{/i}"
